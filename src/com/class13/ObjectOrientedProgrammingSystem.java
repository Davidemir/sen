	 * 
	 * Java is an Object-Oriented Language. The popular object-oriented languages
	 * are Java, C#, PHP, Python, C++, etc. Object-Oriented Programming is a
	 * methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It
	 * simpliﬁes the software development and maintenance
	 * 
	 * 
	 * =====CLASS=====
	 * 
	 * A class is a user deﬁned blueprint from which objects are created. 
	 * Class is template for creating different objects 
	 * which deﬁnes its properties and behaviours. 
	 * In order to create an object you need a class A class contains;
	 * ==> variables , methods, constructors , blocks , nested class and interface etc. 
	 * You can have multiple objects for the same class.
	 * 
	 * Declaring Objects (Also called instantiating a class) When an object of a
	 * class is created, the class is said to be instantiated. All the instances
	 * share the attributes and the behavior of the class
	 * 
	 * ==>Class can have attributes and behaviors . 
	 * ==>In Programming to define attribute we are using variables and 
	 * ==>o represent behavior we will be using methods. 
	 * ==>If we do not have a class we CANNOT create an object 
	 * ==>Behavior is represent as method() in the class We can define as many methods as we need
	 * 
	 * ==>Any class without main method is NOT executable In order for your java
	 * code to be executed we need main method
	 * 
	 * ==>Class is logical entity whereas Object is physical entity (something you
	 * can touch and feel)
	 * 
	 * 
	 * =====OBJECT=====
	 * 
	 * Object is a basic unit of Object Oriented Programming and represents the real
	 * life entities. An object consists of :
	 * 
	 * ==> State: It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reﬂects the
	 * properties of an object.
	 *
	 * ==>Behavior: It is represented by methods of an object. It also reﬂects the
	 * response of an object with other objects.
	 * 
	 * ==>Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to
	 * interact with other objects.
	 *
	 * Example of an object : chair, pen, table, keyboard, bike, etc
	 * 
	 * Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. They
	 * have states and behaviors.
