	/* 4 Main OOPS(object Oriented Progragmming System) concepts: 
	 * 
	 * 1. Inheritance - process of subclass accessing all properties and behavior of 
	 * a super class Single, Multilevel, Hieracial,
	 * Multiple (available only with concept of Interfaces), Hybrid (combination of 2 more)  
	 * 
	 * 2. Polymorphism - process when object can take many form/behaviour
	 * Static Polymorphism/ Early Binding / Compile Time --> achieved trough method overloading 
	 * Dynamic Polymorphism/ Late Binding/ Run Time --> achieved trough method overrdding
	 * 
	 * 3. Abstraction -process of hiding implementation details Achieved trough
	 * Abstract Classes and Intefaces
	 * 
	 * 4. Encapsulaton - process of wrapping variable and method in a single unit (Class) 
	 * Best example of Encapsulation is a class 
	 * To create a tighlty encapsulated class we need :
	 * 
	 * 1. create a private data memebers (variables)==> it makes method hidding
	 * 
	 * 2.create public methods to access those variables (getters and setter)
	 * ==> normally we can not access with private accesss modifier another class or package
	 * but when we create public methods to access those variables (getters and setter)
	 * we can access private variables with our own methods in another class.
