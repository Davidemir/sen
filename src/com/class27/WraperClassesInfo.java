	/*
	 * Wrapper classes - is class that convert primitive types into an Object types
	 * Each Java primitive has a corresponding wrapper: 
	 * ==> boolean, byte, short, char, int, long, float, double ==> primative type
	 * ==> Boolean, Byte, Short, Character, Integer, Long, Float, Double ==> Wrapper Class
	 * 
	 * Autoboxing ==> converting primitive type into an Object type(non primitive types)
	 * AutoUnboxing ==> converting Object type(non primitive types) into an primitive type
	 * (when u use the autoUNboxing u canNOT access ANY specific methods)
	 * 
	 *========================= Why do we need Wrapper Class? =======================
	 *if we wanna work with collections inside those collections we can not primitive, 
	 *u can only store object types but since we have primitive(int, long,double..)how can we store ? ==>use a wrapper classes
	 *wrapper classes convert primitive to object.
	 *Using wrapper classes we store converted primitive types inside our collections (number, charactres, boolean)
