	/*==================DIFFRENCES BETWEEN ABSTRACT AND INTERFACE ====================
	 *  ******************************************************************************
	 *  
	 *1. The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class
	 *while  The interface keyword is used to declare interface
	 *
	 *2. Abstract class does not support multiple inheritance
	 *while  Interface support multiple inheritance.
	 *
	 *3. Abstract class contains Constructors while  Interface doesn't contain Constructors.
	 *
	 *4. Abstract class no restriction in(it has defined(implemented) and undefined methods(unimplemented)
	 *while In Inteface we have only abstract method(unimplemented), 
	 *but since JAva 8 we can have default and static implemented methods.  
	 *
	 *5. Abstract Class can be any access modifier except private 
	 *while Inside Interface abstract method can be only public.
	 *
	 *6. Abstract class can have final, static and non-static variables and u need initialize them.
	 *while Interface has only final static variables it MUST BE  INITIALIZE.
	 *
	 *7. Abstract class may contain either variable or constants
	 *while Interface contains only constants.
	 *
	 *8. To create a relationship to Abstract classes we use extends
	 *while Interface we use implements keyword.
	 *
	 *9. We can implement multiple Iterfaces but we can extend only 1 class.

	 * ==================Similitaries of  ABSTRACT AND INTERFACE ====================
	 *  ******************************************************************************
	 *  1. Both help to achieve abstraction
	 *  2. Both can have implemented and unimplemented methods 
	 *  3. Both must participate in Inheritance
	 *  4. for Both you cannot create an Object
