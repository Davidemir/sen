	 * Map - Inteface that is not a part of Collection Framework 
	 * Map will have it is own unique methods to manipulate with Data 
	 * Map stores the values in Key-Value pair and each pair is known as an entry. 
	 * (Map - is collection of entry objects which are key and value pair objects.)
	 * Values in the Map can be duplicate but keys always must be unique
	 * 
	 * Map is a collection of Entry Objects Classes that implements Map Interface:
	 * 
	 * HashMap - it's map in which order is not maintained.Allow to have 1 null key and many null values
	 * 
	 * TreeMap  - it's map in which key objects will be stored in ascending order
	 * Cannot have null keys, but can have null values.
	 * 
	 * LinkedHashMap - it's map in which order of key objects will be maintained/preserve==>maintain surdurmek
	 * Allow to have 1 null key and many null values.
	 * HashTable -it's map in which order is not maintained .similar to HashMap.Does not allow to have null keys or null values.Syncronized (thread-safe).
